# 0.8.4 — running $ ledger + status (GraphRAG-parity resolution)

Resolution: **near-parity-or-better vs Microsoft GraphRAG** on global sensemaking,
S1 (community-summary build) **paired with** G-HH-2 (measured S1-vs-running-GraphRAG
head-to-head); HippoRAG-2 a secondary MuSiQue cross-check. Gate frozen as
`src/python/eval/decision_rule_084.py` (design `dev/design/0.8.4-graphrag-sensemaking.md`).
Budget discipline ([[0.8.1-budget-discipline-cheap-validate-and-ledger]],
[[priced-runs-need-resilience-before-spend]], [[airlock-batch-and-provider-protection]]).

## Budget reality — UPDATED with a $0 corpus-measured projection (2026-06-23)

0.8.3 spent **~$38.16 of the $50 program cap → ~$11.84 remaining.** The Slice-0 §7
guess ("$30–60+") was worst-case; a **$0 corpus-measured cost probe**
(`0.8.4-cost-probe-FINDINGS.md`) overturns it: with a **Haiku/Sonnet cross-family judge**
the realistic powered run is **single-digit-to-low-double-digit dollars** (e.g. one
`vector_rag`-vs-`long_context` pair at 100 q ≈ **$4.51 Haiku / $7.40 Sonnet**; a full
multi-pair ~100-q run ≈ **~$8–12 Haiku / ~$15–20 Sonnet**). **The judge tier is the
dominant cost lever** — an Opus judge (~$60–80 full) is what forces a top-up; Haiku/Sonnet
fit at/near the remaining $11.84. **Required pre-run fix:** pin the chosen Claude judge's
price in `eval/gap_decomposition_run.py::PRICE_PER_1M` (currently unpinned → fails closed).

## ⭐⭐⭐ DEFINITIVE (2026-06-23) — LITERAL FathomDB vs RUNNING Microsoft GraphRAG: GraphRAG WINS

`runs/0.8.4-vs-microsoft-graphrag-RESULT.md`. Stood up an **actual Microsoft GraphRAG 3.1.0** (real
pipeline: entity/relationship/claim extraction → **Leiden hierarchical communities** → **115 LLM
community reports** → relevance-scored global map-reduce; gpt-5.4 via airlock, embeddings via a local
shim) over 15 AP-News articles, and ran its **global-search** head-to-head vs FathomDB over the SAME 15
docs, cross-family judged. **VERDICT: Microsoft GraphRAG WINS decisively — FathomDB win-rate vs GraphRAG
= 0.00–0.33** (comprehensiveness 0.06 mapreduce / **0.00** vector), well below the 0.45 near-parity band.
`decide_084`=NOT_REACHED. **FathomDB does NOT reach parity-or-better vs GraphRAG on sensemaking.**

**This OVERTURNS the provisional "community paradigm = graph null" lean below** — that was based on a
CRUDE community-S1 reimplementation (label-prop/60-doc/simple reports) that under-represented real
GraphRAG. The actual Microsoft GraphRAG beats even FathomDB's raw-text map-reduce → **the
community-summary paradigm DOES pay off when implemented well.** CORRECTED decision: the (large) gap
**JUSTIFIES funding a real Microsoft-grade S1 build** — OR record the measured GraphRAG win as the
publishable outcome (roadmap-sanctioned). The "don't fund S1" lean is **WITHDRAWN.** Caveats: 15-doc
index, n=8 (underpowered but comprehensiveness≈0 is decisive), length-bias possible, sensemaking axis
only (HippoRAG-2 multi-hop unrun). Session airlock spend ~$14–15.

## ⭐⭐ (SUPERSEDED) PROVISIONAL RESOLUTION (2026-06-23) — the GraphRAG community paradigm = the graph null

`runs/0.8.4-graphrag-RESOLUTION.md`. After driving a coherent set of **cross-family** (claude-haiku
judge, gpt-5.4 reader, ≥5-run, order-swapped) pilots, the 0.8.4 premise resolves **provisionally
NEGATIVE for the community-summary paradigm** (underpowered/subset/not-Microsoft-package, so
decision-grade not registered-REACHED). Win-rate vs vector_rag (comprehensiveness): **flat map-reduce
over RAW text 0.83 (wins)** · community-S1 + Qwen reports 0.39 (loses) · community-S1 + **gpt-5.4** reports
0.32 (**still loses**). The community-summary structure is a **lossy compression** that does NOT pay off
even with strong reports; the measured value is the **strong reader synthesizing over RAW TEXT**, not the
graph machinery (M1/M2 + Samsung-prior consistent). **RECOMMENDATION: do NOT fund the full S1
community-summary build; ship the cheaper winner (BYO-LLM strong-reader map-reduce over FathomDB's raw
retrieved text).** Two control lessons en route: same-family judge inflates (self-preference, false +0.75);
reader quality is the dominant lever (flipped the same arm win↔loss). Session airlock spend ~$10.

## ⭐ Headline measurement (2026-06-23) — TWO overturns; registered-config premise is POSITIVE (superseded by the RESOLUTION above)

**Airlock unblocked** (HITL-authorized `~/projects/airlock/.env`; exposes gpt-5.4 + claude-haiku/
sonnet/opus). Ran cross-family (claude-haiku judge), ≥5-run, order-swapped measurements through
`decide_084`. Two bias-control lessons, both characterized:

1. **Same-family judge inflated** (`0.8.4-xfamily-pilot-RESULT.md`): a GraphRAG-style map-reduce arm
   that "won" 0.750 under a SAME-family Qwen judge **lost** (0.25–0.44) under the cross-family Claude
   judge → the 0.750 was **self-preference bias.** All $0 Qwen-judged smokes are suspect.
2. **Weak answerer suppressed** (`0.8.4-xfamily-pilot-powered-RESULT.md`): with the **Qwen answerer**
   the GraphRAG-style arm lost (0.25–0.44); swapping to the design's **real reader gpt-5.4** it **WINS**
   — vs long_context **0.72/0.55/0.57**, vs vector_rag **0.83/0.68/0.63** (comp/div/emp);
   comprehensiveness-vs-vector_rag is a **SURPASS** candidate (ci_lo 0.617 > 0.5). map-reduce QFS
   depends on synthesis quality → Qwen suppressed it, gpt-5.4 realizes it (the GraphRAG thesis).

**`decide_084` = NOT_REACHED on both, but the powered run is blocked by POWER (mde 0.19–0.25 > ε),
NOT below-parity — all win-rates ≥0.5.** **Decision lean (registered config: strong reader +
cross-family judge): premise POSITIVELY supported, trending to SURPASS → power up (more q → mde≤0.05)
→ likely REACHES → JUSTIFIES funding the S1 build.** Caveats: minimal subset map-reduce arm (not
Microsoft GraphRAG), underpowered, premise-not-full-resolution. Spend to date ~$2.5.

## HITL gate (Slice 0) — SIGNED 2026-06-23 (design §0)

1. **Honest-prior FUND/NO-FUND — CLEARED, PILOT-FIRST.** S1 funded as a staged bet:
   Slice 5 runs the bounded long-context pilot first. If `strong_baseline_clears` is
   **False** (long-context ≈ S1), **settle the publishable third null before funding
   Slice 10+** — don't spend the big-build budget. A third graph null is a valid result.
2. **Budget — TOP-UP to a powered run APPROVED**, exact $ set after the Slice-5 pilot
   measures per-call cost + judge variance (powered = win-rate MDE ≤ 0.05). Pilot spend
   stays small (cheap-validate + bounded pilot).
3. **Pre-registration frozen** in `decision_rule_084.py` (band ε_wr=0.05, ≥5 runs,
   cross-family judge, surpass-option). **Slice 5 is UNBLOCKED.**

_Slices 10/15/20 stay gated behind the Slice-5 pilot return (fund-the-build verdict +
exact powered-run cost)._
