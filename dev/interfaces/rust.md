# Rust Interface

This file owns Rust-visible symbol spelling and result shape. Cross-binding
parity rules remain owned by `design/bindings.md`.

## Support posture

The Rust facade is stable public Rust contract in 0.6.0 and is the
ground-truth source for engine-side type names. It is not part of the
Python/TypeScript five-verb SDK parity set tested by AC-057a; Rust keeps the
facade shape below unless a successor ADR expands it.

## Public surface

Rust exposes:

- `Engine::open(...) -> Result<OpenedEngine, EngineOpenError>`
- `Engine::write(...) -> Result<WriteReceipt, EngineError>`
- `Engine::search(...) -> Result<SearchResult, EngineError>`
- `Engine::close(...) -> Result<(), EngineError>`

`OpenedEngine` contains:

- `engine`
- `report`

`report` is the `OpenReport` owned by `design/engine.md`.

## Engine-attached instrumentation / control methods

These are public instance methods, not extra top-level SDK verbs:

- `Engine::drain(timeout_ms: u64) -> Result<(), EngineError>`
- `Engine::counters() -> CounterSnapshot`
- `Engine::set_profiling(enabled: bool) -> Result<(), EngineError>`
- `Engine::set_slow_threshold_ms(value: u64) -> Result<(), EngineError>`
- `Engine::subscribe(&self, subscriber: Arc<dyn lifecycle::Subscriber>) -> Subscription`

`drain` is a bounded completion surface for post-commit projection work. It
returns `Ok(())` when the engine-owned background projection queue reaches a
quiescent state before `timeout_ms`, and returns a typed runtime error when the
timeout elapses first.

`subscribe` owns host-subscriber attachment and may carry heartbeat-cadence
options. The payload semantics remain owned by `design/lifecycle.md` and
`design/migrations.md`.

## Companion embedder contract

The Rust workspace also exposes the semver-stable companion crate
`fathomdb-embedder-api` for engine-owned embedder dispatch:

- `Embedder`
- `EmbedderIdentity { name, revision, dimension }`
- `EmbedderError`

## Caller-visible data shapes

- `WriteReceipt` has exactly one public field: `cursor`
- `SearchResult` exposes `projection_cursor`, which names the terminal
  projection-visible point for the search snapshot
- hybrid fallback, when present, exposes a typed branch enum whose values are
  owned by `design/retrieval.md`
- counter/profile/stress payload shapes are owned by `design/lifecycle.md`

## Errors

Rust exposes typed open/runtime errors without message parsing:

- `EngineOpenError`
- `EngineError`

Canonical leaf mapping lives in `design/errors.md`. This file adopts those
types without renaming them.

## Recovery / operator seam re-exports

The `fathomdb` facade re-exports the following recovery and reporting types
from `fathomdb-engine` so that `fathomdb-cli` (the only public consumer of
these types) compiles against the public Rust surface, not engine internals.
These are CLI-only ergonomic types; they are NOT exposed as runtime SDK
verbs (recovery remains CLI-only — see Non-presence below).

Re-exported types (canonical spellings, locked 2026-05-12; extended
2026-05-15):

- `CheckIntegrityOpts`
- `IntegrityReport`
- `SafeExportArtifact`
- `TraceReport`
- `TraceEvent`
- `RebuildReport`
- `RebuildKind`
- `ExciseReport`
- `VerifyEmbedderReport`
- `VerifyEmbedderStatus`
- `DumpSchemaReport`
- `SchemaObject`
- `DumpRowCountsReport`
- `TableRowCount`
- `DumpProfileReport`
- `TruncateWalReport`
- `TruncateWalStatus`

Engine methods backing these types are owned by `design/recovery.md` and
listed in `dev/plans/0.6.0-implementation.md` (Phase 10a + Phase 10b-A).
`PurgeLogicalIdReport` and `RestoreLogicalIdReport` were originally
forward-referenced for Phase 10b-B; both verbs are deferred to 0.7.x
per `design/recovery.md § Logical-id purge and restore — deferred to
0.7.x` and ADR-0.6.0-cli-scope 2026-05-16 amendment. When 0.7.x
re-opens the scope these types land here per the same re-export rule.

## Non-presence

The Rust runtime surface does not expose recovery verbs. Recovery remains CLI
only per `design/recovery.md` and `design/bindings.md`. The re-exported
recovery types above are present as compile-time symbols for `fathomdb-cli`;
the runtime `Engine` does NOT gain corresponding SDK methods.
