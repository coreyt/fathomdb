"""Frozen GO/NO-GO decision rule for the 0.8.2 / M1 multi-hop adjudication.

This module is the *executable core* of the Slice-0 pre-registration. It freezes
two things as code, before any data is seen, so a downstream slice cannot post-hoc
switch the endpoint:

1. :func:`decide` — the GO/NO-GO computation over the **amended** primary endpoint
   (pooled ≥3-hop ΔF1 vs the fixed ``fused+rerank`` comparator, with a trend gate,
   a CI-banded EM gate, and an unanswerable-set confident-wrong guard).
   **Slice 20 imports this; it may not redefine the rule.**
2. :func:`lint_preregistration` — the schema lint asserting the design doc
   ``dev/design/0.8.2-m1-multihop-harness.md`` carries the required frozen, dated
   pre-registration fields.

**Amended 2026-06-16 (HITL — all 6 pre-freeze methodology-review amendments;
``dev/plans/runs/0.8.2-slice-0-prereg-methodology-review.md``).** The original
strict-monotonic ``f1[2] < f1[3] < f1[4]`` dose-response gate and per-hop-max
baseline biased the rule toward the expected NO_GO. They are replaced by a trend
gate (veto only on a *significantly negative* slope), a single fixed comparator,
a pooled ≥3-hop material gate with a paired-bootstrap CI lower bound > 0, a
whole-rule power simulation, and a CI-banded EM gate. ``decide`` now consumes
**already-computed summary statistics** (the Slice-20 harness runs the paired
bootstrap; this function stays pure/deterministic — no RNG, no I/O).

Binding spec: ``dev/design/0.8.2-m1-multihop-harness.md`` §4 (pre-registration),
``dev/plans/plan-0.8.2.md`` §4 (Slice 0 contract, AMENDED 2026-06-16).

Pure stdlib — **no ``fathomdb`` / ``scipy`` / ``networkx`` import** — so it (and
its test) run anywhere, independent of the native-extension build or the ``.venv``
binding. Deterministic: no clock, no RNG, no I/O.
